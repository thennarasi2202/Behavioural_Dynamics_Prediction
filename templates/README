Human Behavioral Changes Due to Social Media Trends

Project Overview

This project explores how social media trends influence human behavior, focusing on two key aspects:

Social Media Addiction Prediction – Analyzing user engagement and behavioral patterns to determine addiction levels.
Impulsive Buying Behavior Prediction – Assessing how social media influences purchasing decisions, particularly impulsive buying.

Objective
The goal is to develop machine learning models that can predict:
Addiction levels to social media (Low, Moderate, High)
Impulsive buying behavior (Not Addicted, Addicted)
These predictions provide insights into how social media affects different age groups and offer suggestions for healthier digital habits.

Dataset
The dataset consists of user responses on social media usage, engagement levels, and shopping behavior. Features include:
Time spent on social media
Emotional impact of being offline
Influence of social media ads
Purchasing decisions based on social media trends

Machine Learning Models
Model 1: Social Media Addiction Prediction
Classification Model (0: Low, 1: Moderate, 2: High)
Features: Screen time, mood changes, internet control, etc.
Output: Personalized suggestions based on addiction level
Model 2: Impulsive Buying Behavior Prediction
Binary Classification (0: Not Addicted, 1: Addicted)
Features: Purchase frequency, influence of limited-time offers, monthly spending, etc.
Output: Recommendations to control impulsive buying

Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Joblib
Frontend: HTML, CSS

Future Improvements
